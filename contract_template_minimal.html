  {{#if isO}}
  <p><strong>OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) Supplies Selected:</strong></p>
  <p>
    This subscription is configured to use OEM toner and ink supplies. OEM products are manufactured by the original
    brand. <br />üÖæÔ∏è OEM Bias (‚ÄúO‚Äù) <br />
    The subscription program is configured with an OEM product bias. This means original manufacturer (OEM) cartridges
    will be used as the default supply source.
    The monthly subscription fee has been calculated based on the known availability and cost of OEM products at the
    time of this agreement generation. In cases where an OEM cartridge has been discontinued and is no longer manufactured or
    available from suppliers, the fallback sequence will apply in the following order: 
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>OEM [O] ‚Üí Remanufactured [R]</li>
      <li>Remanufactured [R] ‚Üí New-Build Compatible [N]</li>
    </ul>
      <p>
        Fallbacks are only used when a product is no longer produced by the OEM ‚Äî not due to inventory issues ‚Äî and
    substitutions will be made in line with product availability from our qualified vendor network.
