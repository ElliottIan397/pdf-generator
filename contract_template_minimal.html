  <h2>Addendum 4 – SKU Bias Selection</h2>
  <p><strong>SKU Bias Selection:</strong> Your Subscription Agreement has been configured and priced according to the
    SKU Bias Option: {{SKU_Bias_Option}}.</p>

  {{#if isO}}
  <p><strong>OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) Supplies Selected:</strong></p>
  <p>
    This subscription is configured to use OEM toner and ink supplies. OEM products are manufactured by the original
    brand.
    <br /><strong>OEM Bias (“O”)</strong><br />
    The subscription program is configured with an OEM product bias. This means original manufacturer (OEM) cartridges
    will be used as the default supply source.
    The monthly subscription fee has been calculated based on the known availability and cost of OEM products at the
    time of this agreement generation. In cases where an OEM cartridge has been discontinued and is no longer
    manufactured or available from suppliers, the fallback sequence has been applied in the following order:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>OEM [O] → Remanufactured [R]</li>
    <li>Remanufactured [R] → New-Build Compatible [N]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fallbacks are only used when a product is no longer produced by the OEM — not due to supply chain management
    issues — and substitutions will be made in line with product availability from our qualified vendor network.
  </p>
  {{/if}}

  {{#if isR}}
  <p><strong>Remanufactured Supplies Selected:</strong></p>
  <p>The subscription program is configured with a Remanufactured OEM (R) bias. This means cartridges that have been
    remanufactured from original OEM cores are the preferred supply type.
    <br /><strong>Remanufactured OEM (“R”) Bias</strong><br />
    The monthly subscription fee has been calculated based on the known availability and cost of remanufactured OEM
    products known to the dealer at the time of this agreement generation.
    In cases where a remanufactured product is not available, due to lack of manufacturing or product coverage, the
    fallback sequence has been applied in the following order:
  <ul>
    <li>Remanufactured [R] → New-Build Compatible [N]</li>
    <li>New-Build Compatible [N] → OEM [O]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fallbacks are only used when a product is no longer produced by the remanufacturer — not due to supply chain
    management issues — and substitutions will be made in line with product availability from our qualified vendor
    network.
  </p>
  {{/if}}

  {{#if isN}}
  <p><strong>New Build Compatible Supplies Selected:</strong></p>
  <p>The subscription program is configured with a New Build Compatible (N) bias. This means newly manufactured,
    non-OEM cartridges are the preferred supply source.
    <br /><strong>New-Build Compatible (“N”) Bias</strong><br />
    The monthly subscription fee has been calculated based on the known availability and cost of New-Build (non-OEM)
    compatible cartridges
    known to the dealer at the time of this agreement generation.
    In cases where a New-Build product is not available, due to lack of manufacturing or product coverage, the
    fallback sequence has been applied in the following order:
  <ul>
    <li>New-Build Compatible [N] → Remanufactured [R]</li>
    <li>Remanufactured [R] → OEM [O]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fallbacks are only used when a product is no longer produced by the manufacturer — not due to supply chain
    management issues — and substitutions will be made in line with product availability from our qualified vendor
    network.
