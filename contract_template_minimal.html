  </p>
  {{else}}
  <p>&bull; <strong>Just-in-Time Replenishment (JIT-R) [Optional]</strong><br />
    <em>This option was not selected in the Subscription Agreement. The JIT-R service is not part of this subscription
      agreement.</em>
  </p>
  {{/if}}
  {{#if includeQR}}
  <p>&bull; <strong>Quick Response (QR) Asset Management [Optional]</strong><br />

    requirements or for ticketing in the event of a machine breakdown requiring a service technician assistance.
  </p>
  {{else}}
  <p>&bull; <strong>Quick Response (QR) Asset Management [Optional]</strong><br />
    <em>This option was not selected in the Subscription Agreement. The QR service is not part of this subscription
      agreement.</em>
  </p>
  {{/if}}
  <h3>2. Extended Service Warranties (ESW) [Optional]</h3>
  {{#if includeESW}}
  <p>The Extended Service Warranty (ESW) provides repair and maintenance coverage for the printers and copiers covered
    under this subscription agreement.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ESWs are assigned to specific devices based on serial number and are included in the Subscription Monthly Fee
      with coverage commencing on the date of the execution of this Subscription Agreement.
    </li>
    <li>The ESW includes on-site or depot repair service for hardware malfunctions under normal operating conditions,
      excluding installations, upgrades, consumables, user abuse, or environmental damage. Service is available Monday
      through Friday, 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM local time, with triage and response times based on issue severity.</li>
    <li>On-site coverage is limited to service areas within 50 miles of a metro region.</li>
  </ul>
  Full ESW terms and Service Level Agreements are provided in the Addendum 4 to this Agreement.
  </p>
  {{else}}
  <p><em>This option was not selected in the Subscription Agreement. No ESW coverage applies - see Addendum 4 for Time &
      Materials repair options.</em></p>
  {{/if}}

  <h3>3. Monthly Subscription Plan</h3>
  <p>The Subscription Plan is a comprehensive, all-inclusive program that automates the fulfillment of ink and toner
    supplies for enrolled printing devices. It leverages real-time monitoring through a Data Capture Agent (DCA),
    enabling predictive replenishment and proactive service. Optional services such as Just-in-Time Replenishment
    (JIT-R), QR-code tracking, and Extended Service Warranties (ESW) enhance operational reliability and sustainability.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>This subscription is tailored to your specific fleet, usage patterns, and supply preferences, including
      OEM, remanufactured, or compatible cartridges.</li>
    <li>The agreement includes a fixed monthly fee based on covered devices, service selections, and agreed output
      thresholds ("guardrails").</li>
    <li>The agreement is designed to reduce supply chain friction, ensure consistent uptime, and simplify print
      management for your businesses.</li>
  </ul>
  Terms are transparent and auto-renew annually unless otherwise terminated.</p>

  <h3>4. Quarterly Business Review (QBR) & Guardrails Overview</h3>
  <p>As part of the Subscription Agreement, the Quarterly Business Review (QBR) ensures transparency, accountability,
    and alignment between customer usage patterns and contracted expectations. Each quarter, device-level and fleet-wide
    performance metrics are evaluated against defined output guardrails.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>These guardrails have been calculated according to your historical printing output patterns and establish your
      thresholds for monthly page volume and device count.</li>
    <li>If usage remains within these limits on a rolling 90-day average throughout the term, no changes are made to
      this agreement.</li>
    <li>If deviations are detected — either sustained overuse or underutilization — recommendations will be
      presented to right-size the subscription.</li>
    <li>These recommendations could include adjusting the subscription tier, to compensate for changes in output volume
      or the fleet size.</li>
  </ul>
  The QBR process supports a proactive service model that balances cost efficiency, service quality, and contract
  integrity, ensuring the subscription continues to meet the evolving needs of the customer without surprises. The
  guardrails associated with this Subscription Agreement are detailed in Addendum 3.</p>

  <h3>5. Billing & Payment</h3>
  <p>Subscription fees are billed monthly in advance and are payable by credit card. By mutual agreement, ACH (Automated
    Clearing House) payments may be arranged as an alternative payment method.<br />
  <ul>
    <li>All invoices are due upon receipt. If payment is not received within 15 days of the due date, the Dealer
      reserves the right to suspend or terminate fulfillment services until the account is brought current.</li>
    <li>A late payment notice will be issued before any service interruption, providing {{Customer_Name}} with a
      reasonable opportunity to correct the issue.</li>
    <li>It is the responsibility of the Customer to ensure payment methods remain valid and up to date. Any
      interrupted services resulting from non-payment will resume promptly upon resolution.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>6. Term & Termination</h3>
  <p>This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and remain in effect for an initial term of twelve (12) months.
    Thereafter, it will automatically renew on an annual basis unless terminated by either party with thirty (30) days'
    written notice prior to the renewal date (“evergreen” renewal).<br />
  <ul>
    <li>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for cause, including but not limited to material breach,
      failure to meet payment obligations, or misuse of services, provided written notice is given and a 15-day
      opportunity to cure the issue is granted.</li>
    <li>If the issue remains unresolved after the correction period, termination
      may proceed at the sole discretion of the non-breaching party.</li> <br />
  </ul>
  Upon termination, services and obligations will cease except those that, by their nature, are intended to survive,
  such as outstanding payments and confidentiality obligations.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Freight & Fulfillment Terms</h3>
  <p><strong>Freight Costs:</strong><br />
    All standard shipping and freight costs associated with the delivery of subscription-related supplies are included
    in the monthly subscription fee. Expedited or special delivery services requested by the Customer may incur
    additional charges.</p>
  <p><strong>Fulfillment Protocols:</strong><br />
    The fulfillment of ink and toner supplies is automated based on device monitoring. Thresholds are determined by
    either the number of days remaining or percentage remaining, depending on the specific device’s tracking
    capabilities. Our goal is to optimize cartridge usage and prevent premature replacement.</p>
  <p>To support accurate fulfillment and reduce loss:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer is encouraged to provide the name and email address of the individual responsible for each device.
    </li>
    <li>This facilitates timely delivery notifications and reduce the incidence of misplaced or unclaimed
      supplies.</li>
    <li>It is common for devices to display low-toner warnings at levels such as 15–20%. These alerts are often
      triggered prematurely by OEM firmware.</li>
    <li>The program is designed to help users confidently run cartridges to true depletion, minimizing waste and
      avoiding unnecessary shipments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Customers agree to make best efforts to follow this approach, as repeated premature replacements may result in
    inventory inefficiencies and increased fulfillment frequency.
  </p>

  <h3>8. General Terms</h3>
  <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong><br />
    Each party agrees to keep proprietary and non-public business information confidential and to use it solely for
    purposes related to this agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>Data Ownership & Privacy:</strong><br />
    Customer retains ownership of all device, usage, and business data. We do not sell or share data. Data is used only
    to deliver contracted services in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>
  <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong><br />
    Our liability under this agreement is limited to direct damages not exceeding the total fees paid by the customer in
    the prior 12 months. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential losses.</p>
  <p><strong>Governing Law:</strong><br />
    This agreement is governed by the laws of the state in which the customer operates, unless otherwise mutually
    agreed.</p>
  <p><strong>Assignment & Integration:</strong><br />
    This agreement may not be transferred without consent. It reflects the entire understanding between the parties and
    supersedes prior communications or agreements.</p>
  <p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong><br />
    Neither party is liable for delays or failures due to causes beyond reasonable control, such as natural disasters,
    labor disputes, or internet outages.</p>

  <h2>Addendum 1 – SKU Bias Selection</h2>
  <p><strong>SKU Bias Selection:</strong> Your Subscription Agreement has been configured and priced according to the
    SKU Bias Option: {{SKU_Bias_Option}}.</p>

  {{#if isO}}
  <p><strong>OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) Supplies Selected:</strong></p>
  <p>This subscription is configured to use OEM toner and ink supplies. OEM products are manufactured by the original
    brand.
  </p>
  <h4>OEM Bias (“O”)</h4>
  <p>The subscription program is configured with an OEM product bias. This means original manufacturer (OEM) cartridges
    will be used as the default supply source.
    The monthly subscription fee has been calculated based on the known availability and cost of OEM products at the
    time of this agreement generation. In cases where an OEM cartridge has been discontinued and is no longer
    manufactured or available from suppliers, the fallback sequence has been applied in the following order:
  <ul>
    <li>OEM [O] → Remanufactured [R]</li>
    <li>Remanufactured [R] → New-Build Compatible [N]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fallbacks are only used when a product is no longer produced by the OEM — not due to supply chain management
    issues — and substitutions will be made in line with product availability from our qualified vendor network.
  </p><br />
  <p>See Addendum 2 for bias assignment by SKU by print device</p>
  {{/if}}

  {{#if isR}}
  <p><strong>Remanufactured Supplies Selected:</strong></p>
  <p>The subscription program is configured with a Remanufactured OEM (R) bias. This means cartridges that have been
    remanufactured from original OEM cores are the preferred supply type.
  </p>
  <h4>Remanufactured OEM (“R”) Bias</h4>
  <p>The monthly subscription fee has been calculated based on the known availability and cost of remanufactured OEM
    products known to the dealer at the time of this agreement generation. In cases where a remanufactured product is
    not available, due to lack of manufacturing or product coverage, the fallback sequence has been applied in the
    following order:
  <ul>
    <li>Remanufactured [R] → New-Build Compatible [N]</li>
    <li>New-Build Compatible [N] → OEM [O]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fallbacks are only used when a product is no longer produced by the remanufacturer — not due to supply chain
    management issues — and substitutions will be made in line with product availability from our qualified vendor
    network.
  </p><br />
  <p>See Addendum 2 for bias assignment by SKU by print device</p>
  {{/if}}

  {{#if isN}}
  <p><strong>New Build Compatible Supplies Selected:</strong></p>
  <p>The subscription program is configured with a New Build Compatible (N) bias. This means newly manufactured,
    non-OEM cartridges are the preferred supply source.
  </p>
  <h4>New-Build Compatible (“N”) Bias</h4>
    <p>The monthly subscription fee has been calculated based on the known availability and cost of New-Build (non-OEM)
    compatible cartridges known to the dealer at the time of this agreement generation.
    In cases where a New-Build product is not available, due to lack of manufacturing or product coverage, the
    fallback sequence has been applied in the following order:
  <ul>
    <li>New-Build Compatible [N] → Remanufactured [R]</li>
    <li>Remanufactured [R] → OEM [O]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fallbacks are only used when a product is no longer produced by the manufacturer — not due to supply chain
    management issues — and substitutions will be made in line with product availability from our qualified vendor
    network.
